Bot Dialogue & Flow
AA1 Bot:
Good morning, Tony.
I’ll check you in for this beautiful day at [System Time].

You’ve got a full plate today (change so its not static every day) , so I just want to make sure you’re ready to take it on.
Are you able to work a full day today?

If YES:
Great — let’s get moving.
As we go through the day, I’ll help where needed or get your Acquisition Manager involved if anything stalls.
Before we jump in, is there anything you already know you’ll need help with today?

If help needed:
Got it. I’ll send a note to your AM right now so they can support you before we start.  It will ask what it is, it will create the content and ask it its correct then send 

Next prompt (daily objective alignment):
Alright Tony, today we’re going to go over all your active properties
and call about 30 agents (actions for today: # for New Agent Calls)  with high-propensity-to-sell listings.

Is there anything that might prevent you from getting those calls done today?

If YES (blockers identified):
Understood — I’ll make a note of that and send an update to your AM.
Let’s clear what we can now so you can focus on the calls.

If NO:
Perfect. You’re locked in for a full day.
I’ll mark you as available and load your Action Plan to get started.

System: Dialpad opens → Bot mutes and transcribes the call.
AA2 Bot (after call ends):
Okay Tony, based on your call, here’s what I’ve done and what’s next:

I reviewed your call summary and transcribed it to Notes.
I updated the logs with relevant information.
Let’s change/or keep the offer status to: [Offer Status Value].
I’ve also set a reminder for you to call again in two days.

Based on what you said, I recommend turning on/keeping  the AutoTracker: [Recommended Tracker Name].
(if not on) Would you like me to turn that tracker on and complete the updates for you?


4. If YES (Approve AutoTracker Activation)
AA2 Bot:
Got it. I’ve updated your offer status to [Offer Status Value],

Log user’s response in Notes (e.g., “Manual follow-up – no AutoTracker activated”)


Maintain current reminder if outside of PIR  ( days)


Continue to next property after note confirmation



6. If NO to Initial Call (Declines Dial)
AA2 Bot:
Understood. Remember, this is a full-contact Sport” — calls build relationships and get deals done.
Since you decided not to call, I’ll note that decision.

Let’s at least send a text and follow up with an email so the xts and emails until they respond?
