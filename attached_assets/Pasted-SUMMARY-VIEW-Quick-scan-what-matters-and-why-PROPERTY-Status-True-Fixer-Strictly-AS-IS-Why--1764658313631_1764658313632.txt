SUMMARY VIEW

(Quick-scan — what matters and why)

PROPERTY
Status: True Fixer / Strictly AS-IS
Why it Matters: The “No Repairs / Credits” term eliminates all retail buyers. Only investors or cash players qualify. The play here is speed and certainty — whoever moves first wins.

SELLER
Status: Critical Distress (NOD + Tax + Death)
Why it Matters: Seller’s losing equity every day. Foreclosure and tax penalties are stacking. Death in title adds urgency — the estate must close fast.

AGENT
Status: Aaron Mills – Tier 2 (Investor-Friendly)
Why it Matters: He already works with LLC buyers (LA21G $1.95M / MA Group $1.05M). He doesn’t need education — he needs confidence you’ll perform.

APPROACH
Status: Status-Based Pressure
Why it Matters:
• If Active → Offer double-end, push immediate access.
• If Pending → Question buyer’s deposit / performance.
• If Aged → Use “expiration pressure” and unpaid taxes to trigger movement.

FULL REPORT VIEW

(Deep dive — all execution data, no fluff)

PROPERTY

Terms: “Strictly AS-IS.” No repairs / credits / allowances.

Condition: Non-financeable fixer; full renovation required.

Strategy: Price must be set upfront based on current condition — no re-trade later. Compete on speed, not dollars.

SELLER

Distress Indicators:
• Notice of Trustee Sale (8 pts)
• Notice of Default (6 pts)
• Tax Delinquency (5 pts)
• Affidavit of Death (5 pts)
• Bankruptcy / Judgment (4 pts)

Strategic Insight: Seller has zero holding power. Every delay compounds debt. They’ll take certainty over top-price — deliver proof of funds and a tight timeline.

AGENT – AARON MILLS (Full Alignment Data)

Classification: Tier 2 — Mid-Value Agent / Investor Networked

Role Combination: 4 (Regional focus + Investor clients)

Production Level: Low volume / High relevance

Investor Clients:
• LA21G LLC – $1.95M (High-value acquisition)
• MA Group LLC – $1.05M (Mid-range investment)
• Constar International / BDI Enterprise – Smaller plays

Partners: Goldman Sachs Bank USA (lender), First American Title

Insight: Understands investor structure, funding timelines, and double-end value. Speaks deal fluently — talk performance, not process.

APPROACH – EXECUTION SCRIPTS

1. Active (New Listing / Just Hit Market)
“Hey Aaron, saw you just listed that fixer. I know you work with LA21G and MA Group — we’re in that same lane. Since it’s Strictly AS-IS, if I bring a clean cash offer today, can you represent me (double-end) and meet me at the property?
If not, what’s the seller’s plan — Best and Final date or first solid offer wins?”

2. Pending / Backup (Deposit Check)
“Hey Aaron, congrats on pending the deal. Given the NOD and tax delinquency, timing’s tight. Has your buyer actually dropped their hard deposit yet or still verbal? If they stall, I can step in with a hard offer today so you don’t lose momentum.”

3. Aged (70+ Days / Expiration Pressure)
“Hey Aaron, this one’s been sitting since [Date]. With the NOD and tax issues, the seller’s bleeding equity every day. Why hasn’t it moved? Would they consider a quick cash exit before the listing expires?”
