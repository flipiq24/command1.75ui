Complete Replit Prompt: My Stats Page Restructure
Overview
Update the My Stats page to reorganize metrics into logical categories (Deal Pipeline & Agent Outreach), improve date filtering with smart defaults, split Relationships into New and Upgraded, convert time to hours, and enhance the AI coach for end-of-day actionable guidance.

1. DATE FILTER CHANGES
Current State: Static "Weekly" dropdown with "Refresh" button and fixed date display "Feb 02 - Feb 08, 2026"
New State: Dynamic dropdown with smart defaults based on time of day
Dropdown Options:

Yesterday (default if before 12:00 PM local time)
Today (default if 12:00 PM or later local time)
Weekly
Monthly
Yearly
Custom (opens date range picker)

Implementation Logic:
typescriptconst [dateFilter, setDateFilter] = useState<'yesterday' | 'today' | 'weekly' | 'monthly' | 'yearly' | 'custom'>(() => {
  const hour = new Date().getHours();
  return hour < 12 ? 'yesterday' : 'today';
});

const getDateRangeDisplay = (filter: string): string => {
  const today = new Date();
  const yesterday = new Date(today);
  yesterday.setDate(yesterday.getDate() - 1);
  
  switch(filter) {
    case 'yesterday':
      return formatDate(yesterday);
    case 'today':
      return formatDate(today);
    case 'weekly':
      // Return week range
    case 'monthly':
      // Return month range
    case 'yearly':
      // Return year range
    case 'custom':
      // Return custom selected range
  }
};
```

**Key Behaviors:**
- Date display dynamically updates based on dropdown selection
- All sections (Stats Cards, Team Leaderboard, Performance Report) filter based on this single dropdown
- Remove the separate "Refresh" button (data auto-refreshes on filter change)

Chat Response Logic:

  const lowerMessage = userMessage.toLowerCase();
  
  // Topic detection
  if (lowerMessage.includes('call')) {

  }
  if (lowerMessage.includes('relationship') || lowerMessage.includes('agent')) {
    return generateRelationshipsInsight(stats, timeOfDay);
  }
  if (lowerMessage.includes('offer')) {
    return generateOffersInsight(stats, timeOfDay);
  }
  if (lowerMessage.includes('time')) {
    return generateTimeInsight(stats, timeOfDay);
  }
  if (lowerMessage.includes('improve') || lowerMessage.includes('better') || lowerMessage.includes('help')) {
    return generateImprovementPlan(stats, timeOfDay);
  }
  
  // Default helpful response
  return generateDefaultHelp();
