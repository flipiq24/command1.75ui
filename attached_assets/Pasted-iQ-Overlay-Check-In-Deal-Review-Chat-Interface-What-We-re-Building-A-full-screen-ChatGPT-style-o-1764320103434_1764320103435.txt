iQ Overlay — Check-In + Deal Review Chat Interface
What We're Building
A full-screen ChatGPT-style overlay that launches when the user clicks the iQ button in the sidebar. The overlay covers the entire main content area while keeping the left sidebar navigation visible.
Core Behavior
Trigger: User clicks the iQ lightbulb button (highlighted in sidebar)
Overlay Layout:

Full width/height of main content area (everything right of sidebar)
Clean white/light gray background
Chat messages stream from top, input fixed at bottom
No other UI elements visible except sidebar nav

Flow Sequence
Phase 1: Check-In (AA1 Bot)
When overlay launches, the AI initiates conversation:
Good morning, [User Name].
I'll check you in for this beautiful day at [Current Time].

You've got a solid lineup today, so I want to make sure you're ready.
Are you able to work a full day today?
User responds (yes/no via buttons or typed response).
If YES → AI responds:
Great — let's get moving.
Before we jump in, is there anything you already know you'll need help with today?
If help needed → AI captures it, confirms, says it will notify AM.
Then AI presents the daily summary:
Alright [Name], today we're going to:
- Review 56 properties in Deal Review
- Make about 30 calls to high-propensity agents

Is there anything that might prevent you from getting those calls done today?
Captures any blockers, then displays:
[Start Deal Review] ← Primary CTA button in chat

Phase 2: Deal Review (AA2 Bot)
When user clicks "Start Deal Review," AI transitions:
Loading your Deal Review...
