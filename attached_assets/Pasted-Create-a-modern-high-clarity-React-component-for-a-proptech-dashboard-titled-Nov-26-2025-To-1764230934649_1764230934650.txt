Create a modern, high-clarity React component for a proptech dashboard titled:

“Nov 26, 2025 — Today’s Action Plan!”

The component must contain FOUR large circular progress indicators:
- Hot Deals
- Warm Deals
- Cold Deals
- New Deals

### REQUIREMENTS

### 1. GENERAL LAYOUT
Display all four circles in a single row on desktop and collapse to 2x2 grid on mobile.

Top title:
- Large, bold text: “Nov 26, 2025 — Today’s Action Plan!”
- Subheader: “Deals to Follow Up Today:”

### 2. CIRCLE STYLE
Each circle uses:
- Thick progress ring
- Inner text show: “0/1”, “0/8”, “0/5”, “56/60”
- Below the circle: the label (Hot Deals, Warm Deals, Cold Deals, New Deals)
- Below label: small status line, e.g. “Status: 0/1/1”
- Very clear color coding:
    - Hot Deals: Red (#E53935)
    - Warm Deals: Orange (#FB8C00)
    - Cold Deals: Blue (#1E88E5)
    - New Deals: Green (#43A047)

### 3. CTAs UNDER EACH CIRCLE
Below the labels add a CTA button for each item:

Hot Deals → “View Hot Deals”
Warm Deals → “Review Warm Deals”
Cold Deals → “Open Cold Deals”
New Deals → “Process New Deals”

Buttons:
- Rounded, colored border based on the circle color
- Hover state darkens color
- Clickable callback props exposed: onHotClick, onWarmClick, etc.

### 4. TOOLTIP / HOVER INTERACTION
Hovering on each circle shows a tooltip with this text:

- Hot Deals:
  “These deals require immediate follow-up. 0 completed out of 1. Total: 1.”
- Warm Deals:
  “Warm leads showing moderate engagement. 0 completed out of 8. Total: 8.”
- Cold Deals:
  “Cold leads with low recent engagement. 0 completed out of 5. Total: 5.”
- New Deals:
  “New incoming deals for review. 56 completed out of 60. Total: 60.”

Tooltips must be:
- Clean white box with shadow
- Positioned near the circle
- Fade in/out smoothly

### 5. VISUAL HIERARCHY
- Circles must be LARGE and unmistakable.
- Labels must be bold and centered.
- Status line is smaller but readable.
- Buttons have strong visual weight but not overpowering the circles.

### 6. TECH
- Use React + TailwindCSS
- Use a circular progress SVG (or Tailwind-based ring with mask)
- Component must be self-contained
- Export default React component

### 7. FINAL DELIVERABLE
Return:
- Complete React component (JSX)
- Tailwind classes for all styling
- Tooltip logic
- Progress circle logic
- Fully responsive layout

This UI must feel premium, clean, and highly actionable for proptech operators who need clarity at a glance.
