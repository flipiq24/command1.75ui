Only surface a variable if it is present on the subject OR meaningfully different across comps.
If the condition does not exist, do not mention it.
No “FYI”, no empty checks, no neutral statements.

Silence is the correct output when something is irrelevant.

COLUMN 1: PROPERTY (STRUCTURE / USE)
Variable	When to Show	Explanation (Only When Shown)
Stories / Layout	Subject or comps differ	Single-story vs two-story homes appeal to different buyer pools even at similar sqft.
Architectural Style	Style differs meaningfully within tract	Certain styles carry premiums or discounts within the same micro-market.
Garage Type & Capacity	Mismatch exists	Attached vs detached garage or car count differences affect usability and buyer appeal.
Parking Capacity	Subject or comps have atypical parking	Additional parking can materially impact desirability in dense or family neighborhoods.
ADU / Guest House / Auxiliary Unit	Present on subject or any comp	Additional living units change buyer pool and should not be treated as apples-to-apples.
Ceiling Height / Volume	Subject or top comps have vaulted/high ceilings	Higher ceilings increase perceived quality even when sqft is similar.
Solar	Property has solar	Solar present — specify Owned, Leased, or Unknown. Buyer response differs materially by type.
Property Attachment	Attached vs detached differs	Detached SFRs should not be directly compared to attached or PUD properties.
COLUMN 2: LOT (USABILITY & FUNCTION)
Variable	When to Show	Explanation (Only When Shown)
Lot Shape	Irregular vs standard exists	Irregular or pie-shaped lots affect yard usability and future expansion.
Lot Usability	Partial usability exists	Slopes, easements, or constraints reduce functional outdoor space.
Topography	Sloped / hillside present	Flat lots differ materially from sloped or hillside lots in buyer perception.
RV / Boat Parking	Subject or comps have it	Dedicated RV or boat access carries a premium in many markets.
Pool	Pool mismatch exists	Pool presence changes buyer pool and price behavior — must be flagged.
Auxiliary Buildings	Permanent structures present	Workshops, studios, or sheds add functional value and affect comparability.
Horse Property / Horse Zoning	Present on subject or comps	Horse zoning attracts a niche buyer pool and is not comparable to standard residential.
Flag Lot	Flag configuration present	Flag lots trade accessibility for privacy and behave differently in the market.
Corner Lot	Corner exposure exists	Corner lots have higher exposure and different traffic/privacy dynamics.
COLUMN 3: LOCATION (EXTERNAL / MARKET)
Variable	When to Show	Explanation (Only When Shown)
HOA Presence	HOA vs non-HOA differs	HOA rules, fees, and amenities materially change buyer pool and desirability.
Tract / Subdivision	Comp crosses tract boundary	Same tract is the strongest micro-market anchor for comparability.
Water Adjacency	Subject or comps are adjacent	Water can be a premium or a negative depending on placement and perception.
Golf Course Adjacency	Subject or comps are adjacent	Golf course adjacency can be premium or a nuisance depending on exposure.
View	Subject or comps have notable view	Views (mountain, water, park) materially influence buyer perception.
Backing / Adjacency	Subject or comps back a use	Backing commercial, schools, or parking lots often reduce desirability.
Street Position	Interior vs perimeter differs	Interior streets behave differently than perimeter or through-streets.
Micro-Submarket Separation	Physical divider exists	Major arterials or barriers can create sharp pricing differences nearby.
Proximity to Amenities	Subject or comps are notably close	Walkable access to parks or retail can create premium positioning.
Noise Sources (Non-Road)	Present and proximate	Railroads, airports, or commercial noise must be flagged when nearby.
School District	District differs across comps	Different school districts can materially change buyer pool behavior.
Busy Street	Subject or comps front arterial	Arterial exposure increases noise and traffic; relevance depends on local behavior.
