CORRECTION #1 — “Relationships 50% than average” (INCORRECT)

Replit Output:
Relationships — 50% than average

Correction:
The team average for relationships TODAY = 6
Your relationships = 3

Correct percentage is:

3 / 6 = 50% → This part is correct
BUT Replit MUST show:
“50% of Team Average (Team Avg = 6)”

So update the displayed label to:

50% of Team Average (Team Avg = 6)

❗ CORRECTION #2 — Offers Team Average must be explicitly shown (2.7)

Replit Output:
“107% of Team Average”

Missing the number.

Correct version:

107% of Team Average (Team Avg = 2.7)

❗ CORRECTION #3 — Communication Team Average must be explicitly shown (29)

Replit Output:
“32 calls (107% of Team Avg)”

Correct version:

32 calls (107% of Team Avg: 29)

❗ CORRECTION #4 — Offers definition MUST match your exact spec

Replit currently shows:

Offers Sent = Offer Terms Sent + Contract Submitted

That part is correct, but you must REMOVE “In Negotiations” from counting as sent, because it is NOT an offer.

Correct definition:

Offers Sent = Offer Terms Sent + Contract Submitted
DO NOT include In Negotiations
DO NOT include Continue to Follow

❗ CORRECTION #5 — Incorrect tagline under Relationships

Replit wrote:

"3 new relationships"

Correct → must remain:

3 new relationships


But what was missing is that “Upgraded Relationships” do not count inside “new relationships”.

So add the clarification:

New Relationships = Total Added today (does NOT include upgrades)
Upgraded Relationships = count of tier increases

❗ CORRECTION #6 — Team Leaderboard wording

In Replit:

Comms
Relations
Time


Correct universal naming:

Offers

Communication

Relationships

Time

Fix labels:

Offers | Communication | Relationships | Time

❗ CORRECTION #7 — The “Time” tooltip must NOT show “Score”

Replit had removed the Score (correct),
But the tooltip text still implies scoring.

Correct TIME tooltip:

Time Spent = SUM of all module minutes for today
Source: REO.Technology → My Stats → Time Spent per Module

PIQ, Comps, IA, Offer Terms, Agents come directly from their respective rows.


No scoring.

❗ CORRECTION #8 — Daily Performance Header Should Follow Universal Order

Replit currently mixes order.

Correct order should always be:

Offers

Communication

Relationships

Time

Ensure the section order is exactly like this.

❗ CORRECTION #9 — Tooltips must be added to ALL Metric Headers

Replit is missing tooltips in the headers.

Add:

Offers Tooltip (Header)
Counts only Offer Terms Sent + Contract Submitted.
Source:
REO.Technology > My Stats > Offer Status Change KPIs

Communication Tooltip (Header)
Calls from My Stats; Conversations & Call Duration from Dialpad API.

Relationships Tooltip (Header)
New = Total Added Today
Upgraded = Tier increases

Time Tooltip (Header)
Sum of all module minutes for today.
Source: Time Spent per Module

❗ CORRECTION #10 — Conversation % must ALWAYS show percentage

Replit output shows:

Conversations: 8 (25% connected)


This part is correct — BUT it must be required, not optional.
So add:

% Connected is mandatory and MUST appear whenever calls exist.
