REPLIT PROMPT — DAILY OUTREACH UI UPDATE

Objective
Update the “Today’s Outreach Plan” section to clarify actions, reduce confusion, and align behavior with relationship-first execution.

LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS

Keep the three primary buttons at the top.

Change the button order (left → right) to:

Send Campaigns

Call Your Priority Agents

Build Relationships While Chasing Deals

Remove the existing “Ready to Start?” section entirely.

Add a three-column explanatory section directly under the buttons.

Each column must align vertically with its corresponding button.

Content must be static and visible until any button is clicked.

When a button is clicked, the explanatory section disappears and the workflow loads.

COLUMN CONTENT (USE EXACT STRUCTURE + ORDER)
COLUMN 1 — Send Campaigns

Heading
Send Campaigns

Subheading
Relationship Maintenance

Body Copy
The system selects agents from your Hot, Warm, and Cold called relationships.
These are lower-value agents where you have already made initial contact and planted the seed.
You can send templated or custom messages.

Why It Matters
By staying in touch every few weeks, you stay top-of-mind.
When these agents trip over a deal — and often lack strong buyer relationships — you are the squeaky wheel they remember to send it to.

COLUMN 2 — Call Your Priority Agents

Heading
Call Your Priority Agents

Subheading
High-Value Relationship Building

Body Copy
Priority Agents are investor-friendly, high-volume agents you are building relationships with or actively chasing.

Why It Matters
Your job is to build the relationship and provide real value.
These agents require phone calls, not texts or emails.
The goal is that they send you the deal first.

COLUMN 3 — Build Relationships While Chasing Deals

Heading
Build Relationships While Chasing Deals

Subheading
Deal-Driven Relationship Entry

Body Copy
Command uses your buy box to surface investor-grade properties (light to heavy fixers) at critical moments:

Aged listings (70+ days)

3 days after escrow opens (did the buyer put down the deposit?)

10 days after escrow opens (did the buyer remove contingencies?)

20+ days after escrow opens (why has the investor not closed?)

Wholesalers and investors often overpay to tie up deals. You want to be there when those deals start to fall apart.

Why It Matters
The system helps you identify high-propensity opportunities and equips you with:

Property key points

Seller pain points

How the agent makes money

A script to communicate value

IMPORTANT
Always chase the relationship first, using the deal as the entry point — even if it’s an overpriced fixer.
