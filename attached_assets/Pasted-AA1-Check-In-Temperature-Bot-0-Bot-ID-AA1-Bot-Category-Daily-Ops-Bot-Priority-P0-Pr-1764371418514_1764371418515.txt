Bot Dialogue & Flow
AA1 Bot Opening (Rotate Daily Greetings):
Good morning, Tony.
I'll check you in for this [beautiful day/productive Thursday/exciting Friday] at [9:42 AM].
You've got [a full plate/lots of opportunities/some hot deals] today, so I just want to make sure you're ready to take it on.


Are you able to work a full day today?
If YES:
Great — let's get moving.
As we go through the day, I'll help where needed or get your Acquisition Manager involved if anything stalls.


Before we jump in, is there anything you already know you'll need help with today?
If Help Needed:
Got it. Tell me what you need help with:
[User provides details]


I'll send this note to your AM right now:
"Tony needs help with: [captured details]"


Is this correct? [Yes/No]
[If Yes → Send notification to AM]
Next Prompt (Daily Objective Alignment):
Alright Tony, today we're going to go over all your active properties, Criticals and notifications. After that we will help you connect with about 30 agents with high-propensity-to-sell listings. Once you complete that we will help you connect with your Priority Agents and then send out a few campaigns to your Hot, Warm and Cold to keep you top of mind.


Is there anything that might prevent you from getting to all those items today?
If YES (Blockers Identified):
Understood — tell me about the blocker:
[User provides details]


I'll make a note of that and send an update to your AM.
Let's clear what we can now so you can focus on the calls.
If NO:
Perfect. You're locked in for a full day.
I'll mark you as available and load your Action Plan to get started.

 Visual_Position: Action Plan section - Navigation Guide

Here's your action plan for today:


- 5 critical calls
- 3 reminders  
- 6 hot properties
- 3 new follow-ups
- Several offers still showing "None."


Let's start by navigating to your Deal Review.


[Go to Deal Review →]
Navigation to Deal Review
When user clicks button:
iQ overlay minimizes (stays available)
Deal Review page opens
Properties filtered by priority (Criticals first)
First property automatically opens in PIQ view
Deal-by-Deal Navigation in Deal Review
FOR EACH PROPERTY (in Deal Review, not iQ):
User processes through tabs:
0/2Call Hot Deals
Warm Deals
Warm leads showing moderate engagement. 1 completed out of 1. Total: 1.
Warm Complete
Cold Deals
Cold leads with low recent engagement. 0 completed out of 5. Total: 5.
0/1Open Cold Deals
New Deals
These are new incoming deals that do not have a temperature assigned yet (Hot, Warm, Cold) or are offer status "None" They need to be reviewed and categorized.
56/3
Process New Deals
Once completed user see the gamification then moves back to iQ to start AA2
“You have completed 100% of today's follow-ups.”  


After Deal Processing Complete
AA2 Bot (in iQ):
All done with your active properties for today. This is what you did and why it matters:


Summary:
- 5 criticals completed ✓
- 3 reminders logged ✓
- 6 hot properties followed up ✓
- AutoTrackers activated where needed and notes made


Why it Matters:
iQ's job is to keep you in front of each property and agent when it matters. By communicating with efficiency and staying on top of it, this lets the agent know you're consistent and professional. This will translate moving forward to open escrow and all the way to closing.
If you want to see your deals you can always ask me or go to Pipeline > My Deals and it's all there. You can also ask me and I will get you a report with clickable links to any or all your daily, weekly or monthly work and updates so you can verify all your work is properly processed and easily available!


Great Job!! I'm sending this summary to your AM now.


Are you ready to build relationships while finding deals? :)

Sort by PTFV (lowest first = highest discount)
Apply Keyword and Propensity weighting

Unassigned Phase 2:
Prioritize Unassigned agents with highest Investor Source Count
Filter by property status: Active (≥70 DOM) → Backup → Pending
Sort by PTFV (lowest first = highest discount)
Apply Keyword and Propensity weighting
Auto-Remove Logic:
