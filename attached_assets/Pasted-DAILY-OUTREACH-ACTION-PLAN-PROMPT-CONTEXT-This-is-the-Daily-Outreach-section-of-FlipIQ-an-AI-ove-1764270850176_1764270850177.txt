COUNTER LOGIC:

30 Agent Connections: Increments ONLY when Dialpad confirms a connected conversation (not attempts, not voicemails)
Priority Calls: Same — connected calls only to Priority-status agents
Top of Mind Campaigns: Increments when text/email/voicemail is sent to Hot/Warm/Cold agents

NEW AGENT RELATIONSHIPS (top-right widget):

Increments when an agent's relationship status changes from "Cold" or "Unassigned" to "Warm" or "Hot"
Goal: 5 per day (2 per week × 50 weeks = 100 relationships/year)
