THE NEW UNIVERSAL ORDER (TRUE ACQUISITION WORKFLOW)
Use this everywhere: My Stats → Team Leaderboard → Daily Performance Report
1. CALLS

Outbound calls are ALWAYS the start of the workflow.

Includes:

Calls

Conversations

% Connected

Call Duration

Texts / Emails

2. RELATIONSHIPS

Once conversations happen → relationships are formed.

Includes:

New Relationships

Upgraded Relationships

Priority / Hot / Warm / Cold

3. ANALYSIS (Optional Section, but correctly fits here)

This includes your work modules BEFORE the offer:

– PIQ
– Comps
– Investment Analysis
– Agent Module
– Notes/Reminders if needed

This is where your TIME is actually spent preparing to make an offer.

4. OFFERS SENT

After analysis, the first outbound offer happens.

Includes:

Offer Terms Sent

Contract Submitted

5. IN NEGOTIATIONS

Offer was received and negotiation begins.

Includes:

In Negotiations status count

6. OFFERS ACCEPTED

Negotiation successful → under contract.

Includes:

Offer Accepted

7. ACQUIRED

Deal closes.

Includes:

Acquired

8. TIME (Moved to the bottom)

Time spent across workflow modules.
This belongs at the end because it is diagnostic, not part of the workflow.

🔥 WHY THIS ORDER IS PERFECT

Because it matches EXACTLY how a real acquisition pipeline flows:

Call → Connect → Build Relationship → Analyze → Make Offer → Negotiate → Win → Close → Track Time

This order also helps you and your team visually spot:

Where leads stall

Where agents drop off

Whether the bottleneck is relationships, offers, or negotiations

It becomes a visual “funnel” you can follow from top to bottom.
