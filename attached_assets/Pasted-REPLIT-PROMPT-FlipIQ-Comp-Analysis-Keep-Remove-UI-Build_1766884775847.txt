REPLIT PROMPT: FlipIQ Comp Analysis Keep/Remove UI
Build a React component for analyzing and sorting comparable properties. The UI has three parts: Subject Property header, two-column Keep/Remove tables, and a slide-out detail panel.

PART 1: SUBJECT PROPERTY (Top Section)
Display the subject property in a header bar with:

Pool: Association, Fenced, Heated | List: $599,900 | Owned 15+ years, Trust owned

School District: Desert Sands USD | Tract: Terra Lago | Location: Golf Course Front | Street: Interior (Not Busy)
This section is static - just displays subject info for reference.

PART 2: TWO-COLUMN LAYOUT
LEFT COLUMN: KEEP

Header row with checkbox "☐ Select All" and count "(4 comps)"
Button: "Remove Selected"
Table columns: Address | Price | Status

Below each row, show WHY KEEPING in smaller text:

✓ Best comp - Model match, same tract, golf course front, flip condition, all features match

84612 Terra Lago Pkwy   $655,000    SOLD

RIGHT COLUMN: REMOVE

Header row with checkbox "☐ Select All" and count "(6 comps)"

Table columns: Address | Price | Status

✗ INTERIOR STREET - Subject is golf course front, location mismatch affects value
Clicking any row opens the detail panel.
