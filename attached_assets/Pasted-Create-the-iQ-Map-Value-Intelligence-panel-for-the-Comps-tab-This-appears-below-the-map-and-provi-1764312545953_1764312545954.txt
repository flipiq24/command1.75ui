Create the "iQ Map Value Intelligence" panel for the Comps tab. This appears below the map and provides AI-driven location analysis with streaming ChatGPT-style word-by-word output.

LOCATION:
- Below the interactive map in the Comps tab
- Replace or add alongside the existing "iQ Comps Analysis" section
- Same streaming animation style as iQ Property Intelligence

HEADER:
- Lightbulb icon (orange, pulsing while streaming)
- Title: "iQ Map Value Intelligence"
- Subtitle: "AI-powered location & comp analysis"
- "analyzing..." with bouncing dots while streaming
- "✓ Analysis complete" badge when done

STREAMING CONTENT (word-by-word typing effect):

SECTION 1 - SUBJECT LOCATION CONTEXT:
"Subject Property: 10573 Larch, Bloomington CA 92316

Location Profile:
- City: Bloomington (unincorporated San Bernardino County)
- School District: Colton Joint Unified
- Neighborhood Avg $/SF: $285
- Proximity: 0.8 mi to I-10 freeway, 1.2 mi to commercial corridor
- Lot Size: 36,600 sqft (significantly above area average of 8,200 sqft)"

SECTION 2 - COMP MAP ANALYSIS:
Header with flag icon: "🚩 Location Variables Detected"

"Analyzing 3 comparable sales for location-based adjustments..."

COMP FLAGS (stream each one):

"🚩 $450K Comp (Bloomington North)
Different micro-market. North Bloomington averages $15/SF lower due to proximity to industrial zone. 
Recommendation: Adjust +$12,000 or consider removal."

"🚩 $800K Comp (West Colton)  
Located in Colton city limits, not Bloomington. Different tax base and city services. Higher median income area.
Recommendation: This comp may be inflating your ARV. Consider removing."

"✓ $650K Comp (Rialto Border)
Similar location profile to subject. Same school district, comparable street type, no major location anomalies.
Recommendation: Strong comp — keep as primary reference."

SECTION 3 - VALUE CLIFF ANALYSIS:
Header: "📍 Value Boundaries Identified"

"City Line Impact: Properties in Colton average 8-12% higher than Bloomington due to city services and school ratings.

School District Note: Colton Joint Unified serves this area. No district boundary issues with current comps.

Freeway Proximity: Subject is 0.8 mi from I-10. Comps within 0.5 mi typically see 3-5% discount for noise. Your subject is outside this impact zone."

SECTION 4 - AI RECOMMENDATION:
Header: "💡 iQ Recommendation"

"Based on map analysis, the $800K Colton comp appears to be in a stronger micro-market and may be skewing your ARV high.

Current ARV: $643,184 (using all 3 comps)
Adjusted ARV: $595,000-$620,000 (excluding Colton comp)

The subject's 36,600 sqft lot is 4.5x larger than comp average — this creates significant ADU/development potential not reflected in standard $/SF calculations.

Suggested Offer Range: $650,000-$700,000 based on adjusted comps plus lot premium."

SECTION 5 - ACTION BUTTONS (fade in after streaming):
