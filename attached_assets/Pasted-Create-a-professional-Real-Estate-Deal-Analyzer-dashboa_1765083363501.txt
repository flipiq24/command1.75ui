Create a professional Real Estate Deal Analyzer dashboard using React and Tailwind CSS. The priority is FUNCTIONALITY and DATA DENSITY, not just aesthetics.

### CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
1. **Preserve Complexity:** Do not remove data points. We need all the specific financial fields.
2. **Calculator Tools:** The "Renovation Budget" and "Target Profit" inputs MUST have a visible "Calculator/Grid" icon button next to them. This implies they open a breakdown modal (you don't need to build the modal logic yet, but the UI element must be there).
3. **Logic Flow:** Follow the specific column mapping below.

### LAYOUT SPECIFICATION

**1. HERO SECTION (Top Banner)**
*Goal: The Verdict.*
- **Max Allowable Offer**: Display in a large Blue container. (Show "XX% of ARV" as subtext).
- **Projected Net Profit**: Large Green text.
- **ROI**: Display as a badge or distinct metric.

**2. LEFT COLUMN: "Property & Scope"**
*Goal: The Asset.*
- Input: List Price
- Input: After Repair Value (ARV)
- Input Group: **Renovation Budget** -> [Input Field] + [Calculator/Grid Icon Button] (Make this button obvious).
- Input: Buy-Side Closing Costs ($)
- Input: Sell-Side Closing Costs (% and $)

**3. MIDDLE COLUMN: "Financing & Hold"**
*Goal: The Cost of Money.*
- Dropdown: Loan Program (e.g., Kiavi 75% ARV)
- Input: **Hold Time (Months)** -> *Placement Correction: Keep this here, as it drives Interest Cost.*
- Read-Only: Total Loan Principal
- Input: Origination Points ($)
- Input: Lender Fees ($)
- Read-Only: Projected Interest Expense (Calculated from Hold Time)
- Summary: Total Financing Costs (Sum of Points, Fees, Interest) -> Highlight this.

**4. RIGHT COLUMN: "Deal Targets & Analysis"**
*Goal: The Decision.*
- Input Group: **Target Profit Goal** -> [Input Field] + [Calculator Icon Button] (For adjusting based on ROI targets).
- Read-Only: Total Acquisition Cost (Offer + Buy Costs)
- Read-Only: Total Project Cost (Acquisition + Reno + Carry Costs)
- Read-Only: Unleveraged Profit (Profit if Cash Deal) -> Distinct style to separate from Net Profit.

### VISUAL STYLE
- **Density:** Use a compact layout. Do not use excessive whitespace. The user needs to see the data relationships.
- **Inputs vs Outputs:** clearly distinguish editable fields (white/border) from calculated fields (gray/background).
- **Action Bar:** Add a prominent "Calculate" button at the bottom right.
