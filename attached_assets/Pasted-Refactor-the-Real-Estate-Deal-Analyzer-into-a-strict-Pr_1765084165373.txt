Refactor the Real Estate Deal Analyzer into a strict "Process Flow" layout with 3 vertical columns. Remove the top "Hero" banner entirely. All results must be integrated into the columns.

### COLUMN 1: PROPERTY & SCOPE (The Asset)
*Logic: What are we buying and fixing?*
- Input: List Price ($200,000)

- Input: Buy-Side Closing Costs ($1,300)
- Input: Sell-Side Closing Costs (5% | $13,995)

### COLUMN 2: TARGETS & RESULTS (The Decision Engine)
*Logic: What do I want to make? -> Therefore, what do I offer?*
1. **Target Profit Input Section (Top of Column):**
   - Label: "Target Profit Goal"
   - UI: Create a split input that allows entering a Fixed Amount (e.g., $35,000) OR a Percentage (e.g., 12%).
   - Action: Place a prominent "CALCULATE" button immediately below this input.

2. **The Results (Middle of Column - High Visibility):**
   - **Max Allowable Offer**: Display this as the primary big number (e.g., $165,000) with "58.95% of ARV" small below it.
   - **Projected Net Profit**: Large text (e.g., $40,734).
   - **ROI**: Badge style (e.g., 22.93%).

3. **Deal Metrics (Bottom of Column):**
   - Read-only: Unleveraged Profit (Profit if Cash Deal)
   - Read-only: Total Acquisition Cost
   - Read-only: Total Project Cost

### COLUMN 3: FINANCING & HOLD (The Funding)
*Logic: How do I pay for it?*

### VISUAL INSTRUCTIONS
- **No Header Banner:** The top of the page should just be the column headers.
- **Column 2 Emphasis:** The "Max Allowable Offer" and "Net Profit" inside Column 2 should be visually distinct (bold/colored text) so the eye is drawn there after hitting "Calculate".
- **Compactness:** Keep inputs tight. Use standard Tailwind spacing (gap-4 or gap-6).
