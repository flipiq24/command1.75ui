Create a React component called "StatusPipelineWidget" using Tailwind CSS. 

I need a custom status selector that visualizes a real estate deal pipeline.
IMPORTANT: The "Next Step" text shown in this widget is the primary "To Do" action for the deal and must correspond to the "To Do" pill found elsewhere in the UI.

### 1. Data Structure
Use this exact nested structure for the dropdown options. 
- **Categories (Headers):** Bold, Gray text. These are NOT clickable and must NOT show percentages.
- **Statuses (Items):** Normal text. These ARE clickable and represent the actual state.

DATA MAPPING:
- Category: New Lead
  - 0% None
  - 10% Initial Contact Started
- Category: Working / Nurture
  - 20% Continue to Follow Up
  - 30% Back Up
- Category: Offer Sent
  - 30% Offer Terms Sent
  - 50% Contract Submitted
- Category: In Negotiation
  - 60% In Negotiations
- Category: Under Contract
  - 80% Offer Accepted
- Category: Acquired
  - 100% Acquired
- Category: Lost / Do Not Pursue
  - 0% Pass
  - 0% Sold Others/Closed
  - 0% Cancelled FEC
  - 0% DO NOT USE

### 2. UI Layout
The component has two distinct parts stacked vertically (right-aligned):

**Part A: The Status Pill (Top)**
- A rounded button displaying the currently selected status (e.g., "50% Contract Submitted").
- Background: White with a gray border (clean look).
- Icon: A downward chevron (▼) on the right.
- Action: Clicking this opens the Dropdown Menu.

**Part B: The Next Step / To-Do Indicator (Bottom)**
- Location: Directly underneath the Status Pill, right-aligned or centered to the pill.
- Text: "Next Step: [Dynamic To-Do Action]"
- Style: Small text (text-xs or text-sm), Font color: Orange (text-orange-500).
- Interaction: Hovering over this text triggers a Tooltip/Popover.

### 3. Logic & Behavior

**A. The "To Do" Mapping (Critical)**
Create a helper function `getToDoAction(status)` that maps the status to the specific "To Do" text.
*Example Mapping based on user requirements:*
- IF 0-10% -> "Next Step: Review photos & comps"
- IF 20-30% -> "Next Step: Calculate MAO (Max Allowable Offer)"
- IF 50% (Contract Submitted) -> "Next Step: Await feedback"  <-- (Matches UI screenshot)
- IF 60% -> "Next Step: Finalize terms or Counter"
- IF 80% -> "Next Step: Open Escrow"
- IF 100% -> "Next Step: Start Rehab"
- IF Lost -> "Next Step: Archive File"

**B. The Tooltip (Hover State)**
- When hovering the Orange "Next Step" text, show a Popover Card.
- The Card displays the pipeline stages (New Lead > Working > Offer > Negotiation > Under Contract > Acquired).
- Highlight the current stage in Bold/Blue to show progress.
- Mark previous stages as "Completed" (e.g. checkmark).

**C. The Dropdown Menu**
- When the main pill is clicked, show the dropdown.
- Ensure only the specific statuses (the indented items) are clickable.
- The Category headers should be visual separators only.

### Visual Style
- Use a modern, clean font (Inter or Roboto).
- Ensure high contrast for readability.
- The "Next Step" orange text should be prominent enough to be seen but secondary to the status pill.
