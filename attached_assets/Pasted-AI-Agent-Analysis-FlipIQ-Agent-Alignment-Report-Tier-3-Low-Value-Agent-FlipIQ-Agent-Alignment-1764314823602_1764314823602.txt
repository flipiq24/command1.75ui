Value-First, Alignment-Based Conversation Script
Hi Brian, I hope you're doing well. I'm reaching out as part of a tech-driven, data-rich investment network, and I wanted to talk about how we could potentially work together. I'm not a wholesaler or a middleman; my aim is to offer real value and align with the agents we work with.

I noticed you recently worked with BEAR FLAG HOMES LLC on a property purchase in Garden Grove for $760,000 and also facilitated a transaction for 4MD MANAGEMENT LLC in Huntington Beach at $1,875,000. It's impressive to see the range of investors and markets you're engaging with. I operate in similar price lanes, especially around Huntington Beach and Garden Grove, and I believe there's a lot of potential for us to collaborate.

Given your successful transactions, it's clear you have an eye for deals that interest investors. My network includes direct buyers who are looking for opportunities just like these, and we're equipped to make fast, data-driven offers with same-day inspections and quick contingency removals. If a deal doesn't quite fit our criteria, I can also bring in other buyers from our network, ensuring you always have a pool of ready investors.

Since you're engaging with a diverse investor base, I'm curious:

Do you come across investor-grade opportunities often?
What happens when a listing doesn't fit your current buyer's criteria?
Are you open to doing more investor business?
What would it take for me to earn a shot to work with you? I'm looking to establish a relationship where both sides see great value, and I'm keen to prove how we can be a resource for you.

This approach is designed to open a respectful, value-driven dialogue that acknowledges Brian's existing relationships and accomplishments while
