Replit Prompt: Dynamic Header + Scope Button Logic

Goal
Add a top-level scope button labeled “All My Active Deals” that changes both:

The dataset being shown

The main header text

This makes it explicit what the user is looking at at all times.

UI Changes

Add a button in the top header (right-aligned):

Label: All My Active Deals

Style: secondary / neutral (not orange)

Behavior: toggle scope (not navigation)

Header Logic (Primary Title)

The main title text must dynamically change based on the current scope.

Default State (no override)
Today's Deal Review Plan!

Priority-Based States (when filtered by Today’s Plan)

If the user is in Today’s execution flow and clicks a priority action:

High Priority active

Today's High Priority Deals!


Medium Priority active

Today's Mid Priority Deals!


Low Priority active

Today's Low Priority Deals!


New Deals active

Today's New Deals!

Override State (scope button active)

When the user clicks All My Active Deals:

Header text becomes:

All My Active Deals!


This overrides all Today’s Plan logic

Priority circles are visually de-emphasized (not removed)

Dataset shows:

All ACTIVE deals

Excludes: Closed, Dead, Archived

Ignores “Today” constraints

Button State Rules
Button OFF (default)

User is operating inside Today’s Plan

Header reflects Today’s priority context

Button ON (active)

Button shows active state (pill / check / highlight)

Header = All My Active Deals!

Optional secondary text link appears:

← Back to Today’s Plan


Clicking “Back to Today’s Plan”:

Restores:

Today's Deal Review Plan!


Restores Today’s filters and progress logic

Data Logic Summary (for devs)
IF scope = "today" {
  header = dynamic based on priority filter
}

IF scope = "all_active" {
  header = "All My Active Deals!"
  ignore today_priority_filters
}

Why this is non-negotiable

Removes ambiguity: “Why am I seeing this deal?”

Makes mode switching explicit

Prevents AAs from thinking they’re “behind” when they’re just viewing pipeline

Directly supports execution focus → 2 deals/month

If you want, next step is:

tightening copy consistency between:

“Today’s Deal Review Plan”

“Daily Outreach”

“Process New Deals”

But this header + button logic is correct and complete.
