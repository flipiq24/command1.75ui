GOAL:
Update the Comp Analysis UI to display KEEP and REMOVE comps with structured, comparable explanations
driven by the Comp Analysis Bot output.

This UI is used by Acquisition Associates to understand WHY comps are kept or removed.
The UI does not calculate ARV or prices.

--------------------------------
TOP SECTION (UNCHANGED)
--------------------------------
- Map with subject + comp price pins
- Zoom, pan, and selection behavior unchanged

--------------------------------
SECTION: SUBJECT CONTEXT (UNCHANGED)
--------------------------------
- Property / Lot / Location cards remain as-is
- These cards describe the SUBJECT relative to the comp set

--------------------------------
SECTION: KEEP COMPS
--------------------------------

Header:
- "KEEP (X comps)"
- Green background tint
- Bulk action button: [Remove Selected] (secondary)

For EACH comp in KEEP, render a card with:

1) CHECKBOX (left)
- Allows selecting comp for manual removal

2) PRIMARY ID LINE (bold):
<Address>
Single Family / <Beds> Br / <Baths> Ba / <Garage> Gar / <Year Built> / <SqFt> ft² / <Lot SqFt> ft² / Pool: <Pool Type or None>

3) COMPARISON BLOCK (stacked, compact):

PROPERTY (only if exists):
- ✓ <Factual difference vs subject>
- ✓ <Optional second bullet>

LOT (only if exists):
- ✓ <Factual difference vs subject>

LOCATION (only if exists):
- ✓ <Factual difference vs subject>

CONDITION:
- ✓ <FLIP | GOOD | ORIGINAL | FIXER> — <short factual reason>

WHY KEPT (single line, emphasized):
- ✓ <Primary reason this comp ranks higher than others>

4) STATUS CHIP (right side):
- SOLD / PENDING / ACTIVE
- Color coded (red / yellow / blue)

5) INTERACTION:
- Clicking card opens side panel with full comp details
- Card highlight syncs with map pin

--------------------------------
SECTION: REMOVE COMPS
--------------------------------

Header:
- "REMOVE (X comps)"
- Red background tint
- Bulk action button: [Keep Selected] (secondary)

REMOVE comps are visually de-emphasized but still readable.

Group REMOVE comps into collapsible sub-sections:

A) REMOVE — LOWER RELEVANCE
B) REMOVE — REDUNDANT (BETTER COMPS AVAILABLE)

For EACH removed comp, render SAME card structure as KEEP, but:

- Red “X” icon instead of green checkmarks
- WHY REMOVED line replaces WHY KEPT
- Slightly reduced opacity

WHY REMOVED line MUST state one of:
- "Lower relevance due to mismatch"
- "Acceptable comp, removed due to stronger alternatives"

--------------------------------
INTERACTION RULES
--------------------------------

- User can:
  - Move comps between KEEP and REMOVE
  - Click into any comp for full inspection
- UI does NOT re-rank comps automatically after manual changes
- UI does NOT hide removed comps

--------------------------------
CONTENT RULES (STRICT)
--------------------------------

- Only show PROPERTY / LOT / LOCATION sections if data exists
- Never show empty sections
- Never show “no difference” messages
- No pricing commentary
- No buyer pool language
- No opinionated language

--------------------------------
VISUAL PRIORITY
--------------------------------

1) WHY KEPT / WHY REMOVED
2) CONDITION
3) LOCATION differences
4) LOT differences
5) PROPERTY differences

--------------------------------
DONE WHEN:
--------------------------------
- Each comp card has exactly 6 logical sections max
- KEEP comps visually read as “best → worst”
- REMOVE comps clearly explain WHY they’re out
- UI mirrors bot output exactly without reinterpretation
