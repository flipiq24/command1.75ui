The "Why"Headline: This is a High-Motivation seller scenario (Death & Debt) paired with an Investor-Friendly Agent.The Narrative:The owner is under extreme pressure to sell due to bankruptcy, high debt, and an affidavit of death (The "4 D's"). The property is an aging listing on a massive 36,600 sq ft lot, priced at ~82% of future value, leaving significant room for a discount. The agent, Aaron Mills, is "Tier 2" and actively sells to investors, meaning he will understand a clean, fast, data-backed offer without needing to be educated on the process1.📊 The 3 Pillars of Intelligence1.

The "Affidavit of Death" combined with "Bankruptcy" creates a non-negotiable deadline for the seller. They need speed and certainty over top-dollar retail price.🔽 Deep Dive:The hidden value is the 36,600 sq ft lot5. Most comps won't account for this land value. Combined with the aging listing status (≥70 DOM flags), the market has overlooked the development potential here.🔽 Deep Dive:Aaron is not a "Retail" agent. He works with LLCs (MA Group, Constar). He knows the game. Your pitch needs to be about efficiency and funding, not explaining what "as-is" means.💬 The Alignment ScriptObjective: Prove we fit his existing "Investor Bucket" (like LA21G or MA Group)."Hello Aaron, it’s great to connect. I’m reaching out because I see you’re handling the Larch property, and I noticed you’ve done some solid work with investors like LA21G LLC and MA GROUP recently.I’m with FlipIQ. We aren't wholesalers looking to assign a contract; we are data-driven buyers looking to fit into that same 'buyer lane' you've established with those other groups. We focus on properties like Larch where we can solve the speed/certainty issue—which looks critical here given the title situation.Since we buy in the exact price lanes you already sell in ($555k - $2M), I wanted to see if we could be a backup resource for you on this deal? We can provide a same-day inspection and a clean offer that removes the headache for your seller.What is the best way to submit an offer that makes your life easier on this one?"
