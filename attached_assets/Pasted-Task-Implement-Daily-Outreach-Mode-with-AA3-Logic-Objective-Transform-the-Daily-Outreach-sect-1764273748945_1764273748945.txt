Task: Implement "Daily Outreach" Mode with AA3 Logic

Objective: Transform the "Daily Outreach" section into a focused, single-deal execution mode ("One Deal at a Time"). Use the AA3 Logic provided below to display one property card that guides the user through the call script and action.

1. Layout Changes (Crucial):

Navigation: Move the "Next / Previous" buttons to the Top Right of the Property Card Header.

Cleanup: REMOVE the bottom pagination bar ("Showing 1 of 1 entries", "25/page", etc). It is irrelevant for this single-deal focus mode.

Container: The main view should be a single, large card containing the property info, agent info, and script.

2. Content Structure (The AA3 Card): Display the following sections in the card, top to bottom:

Header:

Left: Property Address (Large Bold) + "Active" Status Badge.

Right: "Property X of Y" text + [ < Previous ] [ Next > ] Buttons.

Section A: "Why This Property" (Yellow/Orange Background Box):

Title: "Why Are We Chasing This Property?"

List specific data points from the logic:

"Aged listing (≥70 DOM) with strong discount."

"Keywords detected: [Distress Indicators]"

"Currently unassigned - open opportunity."

Section B: Property & Agent Specs (Grid Layout):

Left Col (Property): List Price, PTFV %, Propensity Score (0-8), Days on Market.

Right Col (Agent): Agent Name, Brokerage, Relationship Status (Cold/Warm/Hot), Last Communication Date.

Section C: The Script (Blue/Gray Background Box):

Title: "Suggested Agent Script"

Body: "Hey [Agent Name], this is Tony from FlipIQ. I noticed [Address] has been on the market [DOM] days..." (Use the script provided in AA3 logic).

Section D: Call Prompt (Action Area):

Large "Call Agent" Button (Green).

Secondary Actions: Text, Email, Drop VM (Small gray buttons).

3. Data Logic (AA3 Filtering):

Filter the list to only show properties where Offer_Status == "None" AND Assigned == False.

Sort order: Priority → Hot → Warm → Cold.

Style Guide:

Use Tailwind CSS.

Keep the UI clean, white background, gray text.

Use FlipIQ Orange (#FF6600) for the "Why This Property" highlights.
