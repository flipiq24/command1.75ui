Update the iQ Property Intelligence component to have a true ChatGPT-style streaming effect where text types in word-by-word (not all at once). Make it feel like AI is actually thinking and typing in real-time.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. TYPING EFFECT:
- Each character appears one at a time (15-40ms random delay for natural feel)
- Blinking cursor (orange #FF6600) follows the text as it types
- Pause slightly longer between lines (150ms) and longer after headers (400ms)

2. CONTENT ORDER (stream in this sequence):
- Status: Active
- Days on Market: 94 days

- [BULLET] 4 bullet points explaining why we're chasing this property
- [ACTION] "Let's dive into the property details —"
- [BUTTONS] Yes (green) / No (gray) fade in AFTER typing completes

3. HEADER SECTION:
