Got it. You want the AI to give a complete tactical briefing after check-in — not just "here's your day" but a full breakdown of the pipeline with clear goals and a confidence boost. Let me update the prompt:

Updated Replit Prompt: FlipIQ iQ Overlay — Check-In + Deal Review Chat Interface
What We're Building
A full-screen ChatGPT-style overlay that launches when the user clicks the iQ button in the sidebar. The overlay covers the entire main content area while keeping the left sidebar navigation visible.

Core Behavior
Trigger: User clicks the iQ lightbulb button (highlighted in sidebar)
Overlay Layout:

Full width/height of main content area (everything right of sidebar)
Clean white/light gray background
Chat messages stream from top, input fixed at bottom
No other UI elements visible except sidebar nav


Flow Sequence
Phase 1: Check-In (AA1 Bot)
When overlay launches, the AI initiates conversation with streaming text:
Good morning, [User Name].
Checking you in at [Current Time].

You've got a strong day ahead — let me make sure you're ready.
Are you able to work a full day today?
User responds (yes/no via buttons or typed).
If YES → AI responds:
Perfect. Before we dive in, anything you already know you'll need help with today?
If help needed → AI captures it, confirms, says it will notify AM.
If blockers → AI captures and routes to AM.

Phase 2: Daily Briefing (AI Reviews All Tasks)
After check-in, AI presents the full tactical overview with streaming animation:
Alright [Name], let me pull up your pipeline...
